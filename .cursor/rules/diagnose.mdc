# Issue Resolution Guidelines

When re-diagnosing and attempting to fix a previously unresolved issue:

1. **Review Previous Attempts**:
   - Analyze past efforts to understand why the issue persists.
   - Identify any gaps or oversights in earlier solutions.
2. **Reproduce the Issue**:
   - Attempt to replicate the problem to gain firsthand insight.
   - Document the conditions under which the issue occurs.
3. **Deep Dive Analysis**:
   - Investigate related code paths and dependencies.
   - Look for anomalies or deviations from expected behavior.
4. **Implement a Solution**:
   - Develop a fix that addresses the root cause of the issue.
   - Ensure the solution aligns with project standards and practices.
5. **Testing**:
   - Create or update tests to verify the issue is resolved.
   - Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions are introduced.
6. **Documentation**:
   - Document the issue, the analysis process, and the implemented fix.
   - Update any relevant documentation to prevent future occurrences.
7. **Post-Mortem Review**:
   - Reflect on the resolution process to identify lessons learned.
   - Suggest improvements to prevent similar issues in the future.
