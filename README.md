## Next Fast 52 Cursor Rules

This project includes **predefined Cursor rules** to help you get the most out of **AI-assisted development**. These rules where heavily inspired by [@aashari](https://github.com/aashari) and their [00 - Cursor AI Prompting Rules.md](https://gist.github.com/aashari/07cc9c1b6c0debbeb4f4d94a3a81339e) gist.

### Available Cursor Rule Files

| **File**                                | **Purpose**                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`always-on.mdc`</span>            | Persistent base rules applied to all AI actions. Defines project structure, style, and behavior. |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`request.mdc`</span>              | Use when you want AI to build a new feature, refactor existing code, or make specific improvements. |
| <span style="white-space: nowrap;">`diagnose.mdc`</span>             | Use when you want AI to **re-examine or fix** an issue that wasn‚Äôt fully resolved previously.       |

---

### How to Use

1. **Make sure Cursor is installed and running in your editor.**
2. **Pick the Right Rule for Your Intent:**
   - **General AI Help**: _No action needed_, `always-on.mdc` applies automatically.
   - **New Features / Refactoring**: tag `@request` to guide AI behavior for building or improving code.
   - **Debugging / Issue Diagnosis**: tag `@diagnose` to guide AI in re-analyzing and resolving issues.
3. **Interact with Cursor as you normally would.**
   The rule context helps Cursor provide **more relevant and consistent outputs** based on your project‚Äôs standards.

---

### Why This Matters

By using these pre-written rule files, you ensure that:
- AI follows your **project structure and coding conventions**.
- AI applies **consistent problem-solving methods**.
- You get **higher quality, more reliable** results from AI-powered suggestions.

These rules make AI feel more like a **pair programming partner who actually knows your project**.

## üìê Project Conventions

This project follows a consistent structure to keep development clean and efficient:

### üìÅ File Organization
- `src/components/ui/` ‚Äî Low-level UI components (shadcn/ui)
- `src/components/sections/` ‚Äî Custom page sections (Hero, Pricing, etc.)
- `src/components/layout/` ‚Äî Layout components (Navbar, Footer)
- `src/lib/` ‚Äî API clients and helpers
- `src/app/` ‚Äî Pages and routes

### üé® Development Guidelines
- TypeScript for all files
- Tailwind CSS for styling (using theme tokens)
- ES Modules for imports/exports
- Framer Motion for animations
- API clients from `src/lib/` (Supabase, Stripe, AI)

### ‚ö° Core Principles
- Simplicity over perfection
- Ship fast, iterate often
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Clean, readable code over clever solutions
